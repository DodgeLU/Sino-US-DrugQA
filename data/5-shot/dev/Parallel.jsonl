{"question": "Statement 1: Cosmetic product establishment registration numbers in the US FDA system serve as official approval of the firm's products. Statement 2: Water resistance testing for sunscreens in China requires specific inspection reports showing SPF measurements before and after water exposure.", "choices": ["A. Both statements are correct", "B. Statement 1 is correct, Statement 2 is incorrect", "C. Statement 1 is incorrect, Statement 2 is correct", "D. Both statements are incorrect"], "answer": "C", "type": "Parallel", "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect because US FDA regulations (§710.8) explicitly state that registration or possession of a registration number does not denote FDA approval of the firm or its products. Statement 2 is correct as Chinese regulations require detailed inspection reports for water resistance testing, including SPF measurements before and after 40-minute water exposure, as shown in the inspection report template. The Chinese system emphasizes detailed testing documentation while the US system maintains clear separation between registration and product approval.", "category": "Cosmetics", "related_concept": "registration information, water resistance testing, inspection report", "id": "PA_P_00636_011", "match_type": "weak", "match_score": 0.7325780330516602, "lang": "EN", "source_cn": "化妆品注册和备案检验工作规范.txt", "source_us": "PART_710VOLUNTARY_REGISTRATION_OF_COSMETIC_PRODUCT.txt", "old_id": "comp_0071_0001_2"}
{"question": "Which regulatory approach to establishment inspections is more comprehensive regarding agency discretion and scope?", "choices": ["A. The US approach grants FDA broad discretion over inspection timing, frequency, and scope without requiring prior notification.", "B.

Both approaches require inspections only with prior consent from the establishment.", "D.
